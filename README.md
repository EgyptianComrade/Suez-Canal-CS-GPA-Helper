-   A cumulative GPA.
-   A full degree progress report showing completed and remaining courses.
-   A prerequisite check for all remaining courses.

**To get your student response data:**

1.  Log in to the Suez University student portal: `http://credit.suez.edu.eg/static/PortalStudent.html#`
2.  Open the Developer Tools in your browser (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
3.  Go to the **Network** tab.
4.  Navigate to the "Student Academic Register" page or any page that triggers a request to the `getJCI` endpoint.
5.  Find the network request named `getJCI` in the list, click on it.
6.  Go to the **Response** tab.
7.  Copy the **entire** JSON content.

```

This will validate your data and show you a summary before you use the GitHub Action.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Installation (Optional)

If you prefer to run the tool locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EgyptianComrade/Suez-Canal-CS-GPA-Helper.git
cd Suez-Canal-CS-GPA-Helper
```

Next, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Getting Your Academic Data

This tool requires two data files to run: `Response.txt` (your personal academic record) and `curriculum.json` (the official degree plan).

**To get your `Response.txt`:**

Follow the same steps as above to get your student data, then:
1. Create a new file named `Response.txt` in the project directory
2. Paste the copied JSON content into it

**To generate the `curriculum.json`:**

If the `curriculum.json` is not already present, you can generate it from the `meh.txt` file (which contains the full curriculum in markdown).

```bash
python build_curriculum.py
```

### 3. Running the Advisor

Once the setup is complete, you can run the main application:

```bash
python gpa_calculator.py
```

You will be greeted with an interactive menu to explore your academic progress.

- **Semester-by-semester breakdown** with individual course grades
